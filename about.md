# About Me
Hello! I am Mel.
I like listening to music I also like to hang out with my friends and family. I enjoy baking and cooking, I am really interested into pschology and I want to become a therapiest when I am older, I am good at listening and team work. I try my best at everything I do, and i enjoy making people happy, my goal is to help people.

My career top choice is, being a therapist, I want to be able to be a safe space for someone, and I want to be someone where people can confide in. And not to feel judged, I want them to feel heard, I just really wanna help people, and your mental health is one of the most important things to take care of. This connects to my lifestyle goals, because I wanna help people, and do good in this world so being a therapist is a way where I can do good. It's a way that I can help someone a lot, and make some people's lives easier. Some skills from this course that can help me succeed is communication. I need to be able to communicate with my clients, and to listen to my clients, so communicating with my classmates can help me achieve this. And a technical skill that can help me achieve this, is being able to write reports. I need to keep files of my clients, so I need to be able to know how to write reports.
